This week, I have been introduced to a lot of new stuffs that I have never met. Being in the "R-dominating" world of statistics for too long results me in the situation of knowing nothing else but R. That is kind of sad to realize that in my last year of college. The desire to know more about other technologies has driven me to stay in this class which is full of unfamiliar things. I have met many "technical difficulties" this very first week. Some of them are as small as not knowing how to folk an updated repository or how to register a username on IRC. These small questions were quickly solved during the group time on Tuesday. Actually some of my groupmates had the same confusion as I had. I think those problems occor because of we are still new to those settings, once we try some more times , we will get familiar and become proficient. However, there are some bigger questions. For me, the most crtitical challenges are all about the virtual machine.

I met the first ostacle when I had to enable hardware-level virtualization in BIOS. It sounds silly that I had tried a couple of times turning my computer on and off trying the F-bottoms to get me to my BIOS, and I ended up going online and google the key to access BIOS for sony computers. I will remember from now on that F2 gets vaio's to the BIOS settings.

Then my next obstacle came up when I failed to command the virtual machine to do anything. I first brought this up in my group during class and we found out that something must be wrong because I had never been asked to set up login name and password during the whole process of setting the machine. Then I turned this question to Aaron, and I was told that my virtual machine is not fully installed. Besides emailing Aaron for an appointment to get the installation done, I also tried many other ways to figure out what I had missed when it is supposed to be done. I googled many virtualbox installation illustration steps as well as FQAs. At the same time, I also went back and traced the procedure posted in the homework-01.md again. But I still had no clue whether I should uninstall everything and start over again since it was not fully installed. What I googled did not help that much. Thinking uninstall and reinstall might take too much work and might not be necessary, I thought of maybe removing the old VM and recreating it again may be worth-trying to reduce the pool of possible mistakes. So I tried and succeeded! I had my "Aha!" moment when I figured out I did not choose to install the server when I was setting the machine... Though when I realized this time and I follow the steps for installing, I failed to install all the softwares when we was asked to choose what software I want to install besides the core of the system; I went back and unchecked the "manual package selection" then it succeeded to install completely. Everything looks "normal" now--same as everybody else in my group. And I tried to run the command we used in class on Thursday about ipython notebooks and the VM reacts normally. So I assume I have made it work! Of course, I will still check with others or the instructors that I have actually succeeded.

Looking back at this week, I did a lot of trying and testing--trying different approached and testing if they works. I have noticed that sometimes it is a good thing to pause and step back for a while to think about it from another starting point then try a different approach instead of keep trying over and over again and get the same error.
