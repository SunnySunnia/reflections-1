reflections-1
=============

This week is mainly about research experiences and how statistics plays a role in analyzising research results, shared by the two guest lecturers. Aside of that, we are asked to keep ourselves on track--tackle vagrant related problems and have ipython notebook opened successfully on the web browser from virtual box. 

Windows system:
I have windows on my computer originally. I followed everything for running vagrant, however I had problem running 'vagrant ssh' as it returned an error message saying that I did not have SSH installed in my computer. Then I spent a lot of time figure out which ssh client to install and how to install and configure before the GSI announced that we are going to run vagrant on linux system for every windows users instead. I think there's a problem with the gap between what the professor expected us to have in mind and what background konwledge stat students actually have. As we are expected to have ssh but we do not even know what ssh is. Before I get linux system installed, I can access ipython notebook from a command terminal and will be directed to the web browser.

Linux system:
The GSIs had scheduled a session for helping us install linux system and get everything on track. I think that session was sufficiently helpful. During that seesion, we could pair up or group with people that had the same system and were at the similar stage of installing. In such a way, we could discuss and help each other with problems that one may faced before and solved by the GSI. I really liked the way Chris summarized all the steps from starting vagrant to access ipython notebook from the web browser. The list of steps not only helped us keep track of what steps we had done and what had not, but also helped us to be able to reproduce and perform the procedures on our own instead of just following and not knowing what the steps are for. I have successfully completed all the steps and am able to do it on my own. I think my next thing to do is to get familiar with linux system.

Another thing I am concerning is the correct way of 'submitting' our reflections. The way I, and my group, have done is creating a new repository "Reflections" and starting to post new files for each week's reflection. However I have heard that we should folk the professor's 'reflection' repository and edit by posting our reflections, then we should pull request to the professor. I did not know this until Tuesday. And I saw that only a few of our classmates actually did pull requested their refections. GSI said she will ask the professor again for detail instructions about submitting reflections. And I think I should address this with my group, and suggest my group mates to folk and pull request for now while waiting for further instructions.
