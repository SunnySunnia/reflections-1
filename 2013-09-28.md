About reproducibility:  
This week we talked about reproducibility. Through lecture and ideas and experiences shared by Chris and Kristina, I started to some sense about the point of reproducibility. To be honestly, I have never heard or thought about reproducibility before. Because this topic seems not popular and widely influencing, I have never really thought about the meaning and importance of it.

However, after this week, I gained many thoughts about it. In my opinions, I think the point of emphasizing reproducibility is about accuracy and reliability of data used to support any conclusions. This idea could be blended into a statistics sense. As we usually model simulations and experiments with independent subjects and run various tests to try to find out if a specific phenomenon appeared by chance or it is meant to be.

So the fact that if one could reproduce the whole modelling process and get the same result, which could be thought as if a phenomenon would happened if an experiment is to be repeated under the same condition, would be necessary to verify that a result is reliable. This is the way I understand reproducibility. But it is the only point I see why reproducibility is important in data science up to this point.

About the course:  
As we have went through all the preparation process(installing everything), I am much clearer about what we are heading to now. Especially after Chris had illustated the relations between all the different steps in an research study. I think that was helpful. Now I think feedbacks, or ranther, communications are extremely important.
