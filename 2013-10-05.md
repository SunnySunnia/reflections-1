Reflection of the week 2013.09.30-2013.10.04  
-------------------------
On Tuesday, we are categorized according to our leanring styles as data curators, data analyzers, visualizers, and presenters. And we are assigned into groups of 4 to finish a project. Project explanation is uploaded on github.  

On Thursday, Prof. Stark continued his presentation about earthquake predictions.  
Notes are on: https://github.com/SunnySunnia/Group7/blob/master/2013-10-03.md  

Some concerns or feedbacks on this week:  
I think the way that the project is just uploaded on github without a clear explanation directly to us makes us felt confused for many things:  
For example, what are we supposed to do with the example.cfg file; where should we input our real bConnected key whereas we should not.  
How to import the gspread into ipython notebook.  
We even dont know who will be working with us in a group until the end of Thursday.
What is a github push?
etc.  

Fortunately, we can post issures on the questionnaire repository. That is helpful in the way that we can see what problems other classmates are facing and what are the solutions to those problems.  
But still, I think it would be more efficient if we can first meet our group in class first and get some consents on the plan of everything (deadlines for each role, when to meet with instructors, when to meet for final check with everything, etc).  

Furthermore, many of us are new to python. It takes us really long to figure out how to graph on the ipython-notebook by ourself. I think it would be much easier if we could have a tutorial session together.

Right now at this moment, our group's data is not yet ready for further analysis. And I, the visualizer, just figured out how to plot functions, but still need to learn how to plot histograms or other statistically plots.
