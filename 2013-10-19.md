This week we are assigned a new homework focusing on parsing json data and parametrizing visual functions.  
I think the focus of the week is how do you make sure people in the future can access the data that you used to drive your conclusion no matter how many years later.  

Regarding this homework, my role is to modify the codes so that we can visualize the earthquakes of whichever states we want to focus on. I feel more comfortable with this project, maybe because we are more clear about everything.  

Something that I am working on and trying to improve is to finish up setting up the windows of the map for each state.  

I have many "aha" moments whenever I figured out something new on plotting on ipynb.

So far so good.
