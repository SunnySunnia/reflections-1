Reflection  
---

This week, we discussed a rough roadmap for this class for the rest of the semester.  
For the rest of the semester, we have at least 3 things to do:  
* Program (reproducible)  
---data: where from? what formaat? what inpu to model? what output?  
---model: ETAS, 'simple/starks', poisson  
---Github, AWS  

* Paper  
---abstract-summary,ETAS  
---intro  
---methods-how did you do it? steps  
---esults(negative result?)  
---citation-format? how many?  

* Public understanding of science  
---for people dont want to read the paper in detail  
---update wikipedia?  
---short presentation?  

I think having some time during a week to talk about future goals and agendas will be a good way to keep things on track. Doing so keeps us from feeling lost about why we did something or what to do next.  

However, we still need more ideas about how to divide groups and tasks. I think one thing that helps us figure those out is the issue tracker in the new repo. That collects all of our questions about everything, most of the questions posted are still waiting for answers from Aaron. As we will be split in to groups not only depending on roles but also depending on tasks, I think we need more instructions or explanations on how and when to slip. For example, do we discuss and come up with different tasks in class then we sign up to the tasks? Or could we form our own groups and Aaron assigns us different tasks? Or a mix of the previous?
