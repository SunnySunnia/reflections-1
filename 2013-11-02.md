I think we have been discussing and giving feedbacks all the time on lectures during this week.   

As a visualizer, my goals are:  
* Be clear about each step of this project, ie, what each of the horizontal groups' role.  
* Be familiar with plotting tools.  
* Have rough ideas about what plots we will need.  
* Figure out what we need from analyzers and/or data curators.  

Some questions to consider:  
* What format do I want the data in?  
* How should I start working if I havent received the data yet?  
* How has the data been visualized in Luen's paper?  
* What modifications should be done on top of Luen's visualization?  
* Would visualizations be different between the paper vs. presentation?  

What I am working on now:  
* use the earthquake data from last homework, plot some different graphs to see if I can find some patterns on the occurances of the earthquakes.
