For this week's reflection, first I would like to say we have made a lot of progress in terms of making clear of our final goals, decomposing project into tasks for groups, seting clear timeline for the whole project, and completing tasks for last stage.  

By now, we have our detailed proposal for each week which I think will save us a lot of time when we are collaborating within our own subgroups.  

As much as I am looking forward to get this project finished successfully, I also regularly check out how other groups are doing and how may their work help ours. I found that github sharing and massaging becomes more and more helpful.  

For the sake of hoping to advance our final product, I am also thinking some creative visualization of not only illustrating our results(error diagram) but also explaining our model(how are we picking and tuning the parameters) and our process of reaching our results in terms of the whole class. I think there are many we could do in terms of visualizations. I will go ahead and discuss with my group once we have completed our current task--ploting ECDF's of interarrival times of earthquakes of magnitude in sub-ranges(say 4.5-5) for the analyzers to better observe a rough trend for estimating a window function.
