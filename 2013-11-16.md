This week, our group presented the plots of ECDF's of each magnitude range and tested on tuning the parameter u in Luen's code. We also produced plots of successors' arrival times after each event.  

I also went to Prof. Stark's OH and gained many thoughts on guessing a function for window length depended on magnitude. I will first share with my group and try to go a little bit deeper on that, then we will present on Tuesday what we have done.  

In terms of the whole course, I think it is getting more and more interesting because I started to see real progress on this project.  However, I feel like there is a part of the class still doesn't know what exactly is going on and another part does not care how it goes. For our group, we basically find ourselves something to dig into for each week. But that seems not the case for other groups. I am not saying it is anything wrong with that. Because the project now is heavily relying on the analyzer groups, inevitablly, other functional groups would tend to step aside. Then even when the other groups want to give a hand on analyzing or testing models, they have been left too far and could not catch up and contribute at once.

I do not have any ideas how to change this either. People are too adapted to their functional groups and the role that they have been classified to. A problem is that there seems not enough analyzer groups but you cannot made a new analyzer group from the rest of the groups as it may take too long to get them to understand everything and what have been acomplished. I personally really want to finish this project, even if we could not beat the other models. I think my group has the same goal. Though we are a visualizers' group, we already steped into analyzing and trying out some models. Hope we can make some good shots.
