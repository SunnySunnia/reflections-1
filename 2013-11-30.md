This week is the Thanksgiving week, our group, the Quakers, is still working on developing new models!  

Since we only met once on Tues, and we were the only group presented, I cannt say anything else. Our group plans to make a presentation on what approaches we had tried and results to them, so that we can help sum up what we have tried and what we found for the presentation group.  

At this point, we are getting some small achievements. We will have detail results ready to present later.  

There arent a lot of things left to do with one is no taking part in testing models. I think it is time to have every group to do their task-report summarizing everything they have done.
